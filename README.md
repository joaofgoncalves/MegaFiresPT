# Extreme Value Analysis of Portuguese 'Mega-fires'


## Introduction

--------------------------------------------

Mega-fires (i.e., fires with very large burned area >500 or >1000ha) are becoming more frequent 
in several countries of the Mediterranean Europe and especially in Portugal where large human, 
economical and natural capital losses occurred in the last decades.
  
This project aims to explore how mega-fires phenomena is currently evolving in this country, 
which factors are determining their occurrence and the consequences for ecosystems and human 
well-being.


## Objectives

--------------------------------------------

- Evaluate how mega-fires in the 10 or 20-year return time are trending in the last three decades 
(from 1990 to 2017) in Portugal (but also in comparison to other countries in the European 
Mediterranean region

- Analyze the consequences and effects of mega-fires for forest 'health' and biodiversity at 
several levels and scales

- Assess which factors are related to mega-fire occurrence and their increased frequency

- Assess the relation between mega-fires and burn severity - is average burnt severity increasing 
along with the maximum size of mega-fires?

- (...)
